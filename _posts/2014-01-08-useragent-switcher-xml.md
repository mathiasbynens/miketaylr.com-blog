(In order to properly celebrate [Wilto's birthday][bday] &mdash; happy birthday, friend) I finally created a repo where I can maintain and update mobile browser user agent information for use with Chris Pederick's awesome [User Agent Switcher][uas] addon for Firefox.

You can [grab it here][repo] and import it if you find yourself needing to spoof as various mobile browsers for whatever reason.

And then you should have a fancy little menu like so:
