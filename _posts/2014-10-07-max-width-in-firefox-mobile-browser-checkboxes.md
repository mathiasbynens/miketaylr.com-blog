title:  width and max-width on &lt;input type=checkbox&gt; in mobile Firefox browsers

[1078393][bug], with the ever so descriptive title *'Images' and 'Beta' text is cutoff in Wikipedia*, describes a problem with the mobile Wikipedia settings checkboxes displaying incorrectly in Firefox OS, like so:

<img src="https://miketaylr.com/posts/assets/cutoff.png" style="border:1px solid #ccc; max-width: 100%;">

A [friendly Wikimedia developer mentioned][comment] that they're using a technique to do custom checkboxes (inspired by this [blog post from a few years back][hack]), but mentioned that there's no problem with Firefox Desktop. He says the problem is that we're not letting the (hidden) input stretch to the declared `width` which causes the mis-alignment and overlapping of the custom-styled generated content checkbox thingy.

OK. Let's check out what's going on in the user agent stylesheet for forms (that's the built-in CSS file that defines how form elements display by default) of Desktop and Firefox OS/Firefox for Android, ignoring basically everything except for `height` or `width` properties.

[Firefox Desktop][1]:

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  ...
  width: 13px;
  height: 13px;
  ...
}
```


[Firefox OS][2], [Firefox for Android][3] (different source files, but same result):

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  max-width: 14px;
  max-height: 14px;
  border: 1px solid #a7a7a7 !important;
  ...
}
```

So the reason it works in Desktop, but not mobile Firefoxes is because the latter set a `max-width` property on checkboxes. The simple workaround to the Wikipedia bug would be to set a `max-width` in addition to a `width`.

And if you check out this demo I <strike>stole</strike> modified from the [aforementioned blog post][hack] in Firefox OS or Firefox for Android, it's easy to see how mobile Firefox browsers really struggle with this technique. I've removed `opacity: 0` and added an `outline` (because of that `!important` border declaration in the UA style sheet. ðŸ’©) to make it extra clear. ([Here's a screenshot][screenshot] for those on Freedom-hating platforms (and non-mobile readers)).

So without adding `max-width` or `max-height` it *does* work. It's just the version of working that requires you to guess where a hidden checkbox is and have fingers delicate enough to use it.

But given that Chrome Mobile, Mobile Safari, Opera Mobile (Presto) Classicâ„¢... and probably more don't need the additional `max-width` to work around their UA style sheets, I wonder if we could get away with removing it. We might just fix who-knows-how-many custom styled checkboxes out in the wild in the process of doing so. Or all hell might break loose. Only one way to find out.
