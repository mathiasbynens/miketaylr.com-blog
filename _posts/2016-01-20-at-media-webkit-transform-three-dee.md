`@media (-webkit-transform-3d)` is a funny thing that exists on the web.

It's like, a [media query feature][mqf] in the form of a prefixed CSS property, which should tell you if your (once upon a time probably Safari-only) browser supports 3D transforms, invented back in the day before we had [`@supports`][sup].

(According to [Apple docs][docs] it first appeared in Safari 4, along side the other `-webkit-transition` and `-webkit-transform-2d` hybrid-media-query-feature-prefixed-css-properties-things that you should immediately forget exist.)

Older versions of Modernizr [used this (and only this)][oldm] to detect support for 3D transforms, and that seemed pretty OK. (They also did the polite thing and tested `@media (transform-3d)`, but no browser has ever actually supported that, as it turns out). And because they're so consistently polite, they've since [updated the test][test] to prefer `@supports` too (via a pull request from Edge developer Jacob Rossi).

As it turns out other browsers have been [updated to support 3D CSS transforms][caniuse], but sites didn't go back and update their version of Modernizr. So unless you support `@media (-webkit-transform-3d)` these sites break. Niche websites like [yahoo.com][yahoo] and [about.com][wc].

So, anyways. I added [`@media (-webkit-transform-3d)` to the Compat Standard][spec] and we [added support for it Firefox][fx] so websites stop breaking.

But you shouldn't ever use it&mdash;use `@supports` or [`matchMedia`][mm] instead. In fact, don't even share this blog post. Maybe delete it from your browser history just in case.
