title:  An update on issues in webcompat.com
date:   2014-07-14

We just pushed an update to [webcompat.com][wc] today that will allow you to view issues inside of the site. For example, check out this [issue reported about a problem for IE 11 users on the toyota.com site][ie].

For now this is a READONLY update, but one of the next updates to tackle is to allow (logged in) users to add comments, labels, and do the other kinds of issue-y interaction things one does with GitHub issues. For now there's a link to each issue on [GitHub][webbugs] at the bottom of the page if you want to add a comment (which is either super lame, or an advanced agile iteration hack).

We've also got a fancy new privacy policy, the number one requested feature by lawyers and paralegals around the world: [http://webcompat.com/privacy][privacy]

A special thanks to the people who [volunteered their time and skills][c] to this project, especially [magsout][m], [karlcow][k], [calexity][ca], and [tagawa][t].

If you'd like to get involved hacking on [webcompat.com][wc], drop by #webcompat on [Mozilla's IRC network][irc] or dive into one of our [open issues][issues]. And naturally since I'm involved, there's probably tons of bugs that deserve reports and patches.
