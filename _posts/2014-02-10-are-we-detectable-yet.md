title:  Are we detectable yet?

In the great tradition of [modalverb][pronoun][adjective]yet.com websites, I've been working on [arewedetectableyet][awdy].

The basic idea is to track compatibility with major device or mobile detection frameworks/libraries/scripts, based only on a device's user agent string.

A few things to consider:

**The list of frameworks and libraries (and languages) is incomplete**. If you know of a popular framwork or library that isn't included, please [open an issue][issue] (or better yet, send a pull request).

**The list of browsers tested is not representative of the web at large**. I'd like to include data on non-Mozilla mobile web browsers, but don't really have the bandwidth to do so right now. Again, [file an issue][issue] or send a pull request if you'd like to help with this.
