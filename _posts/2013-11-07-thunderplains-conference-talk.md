I just finished giving my talk at the <a href="http://thunderplainsconf.com">Thunder Plains Conference</a> here in Oklahoma City. You can get the <a href="https://miketaylr.com/pres/thunderplains/">slides here</a>.

Firstly let me say that the organizers have been the friendliest, most accomodating organizers I've ever encountered at a conference. Seriously, well done guys.

And finally, I've done some fact checking and my assertion that Sir Tim Berners Lee personally worked on the <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm">SpaceJam</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/pizza-hut_n_3894981.html">PizzaHut</a> websites were wrong. Sorry about that.
